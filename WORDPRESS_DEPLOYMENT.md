- `dist/public/assets/` - All CSS and JavaScript files

## 📤 WordPress Hosting Upload Instructions

### Method 1: File Manager (Recommended)

2. Open **File Manager**
3. Navigate to your domain's **public_html** folder
4. Upload all contents from `dist/public/` to the root of public_html

2. Connect to your hosting account
3. Upload all `dist/public/` contents to the public_html folder

## ⚙️ Contact Form Setup

The contact form currently shows a success message but doesn't send emails. To make it functional:

### Option A: Formspree (Easiest)
1. Sign up at [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Create a new form and get your endpoint URL
3. Replace the form action in the contact form component
4. Rebuild with `npm run build`

### Option B: WordPress Plugin (Recommended for WordPress)
Since you're using WordPress hosting, you can:
1. Install the site as static files
2. Add WordPress Contact Form 7 plugin
3. Replace the React contact form with a WordPress contact form
4. This gives you full email functionality + admin dashboard

### Option C: Keep Current Setup
